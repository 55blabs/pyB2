Penetration testing, or ethical hacking, is a crucial aspect of cybersecurity. It involves assessing systems, networks, and applications to identify vulnerabilities before malicious actors can exploit them. Python, with its versatility and rich library support, has become a preferred choice for penetration testers.
Some of the use cases are:
Vulnerability Assessment and Scanning:
Use Case: A cybersecurity professional wants to assess the security of a client's network infrastructure. They use Python to create a custom port scanner that identifies open ports, services, and potential vulnerabilities on the client's servers and devices.
Benefits: Python's simplicity and networking libraries make it easy to develop efficient port scanning tools. The professional can quickly identify weak points in the client's network and recommend security improvements.
